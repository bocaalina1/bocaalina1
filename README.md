## Hi there, I'm Alina! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca with a solid background in low-level programming, algorithms, and system architecture. Right now I'm in an exploratory phase — trying out different types of projects to find where my real passion lies!

- 🔭 **I'm currently working on** experimenting across different CS domains to find my niche.
- 🌱 **I'm currently learning** AI/ML concepts, Data Structures, OpenGL, and whatever new tech stack catches my eye.
- 👯 **I'm looking to collaborate on** hackathons, CTF, student projects, or open-source work — anything involving an interesting problem or a new technology.
- 🤔 **I'm looking for help with** discovering cool corners of tech! If you love what you do (backend, embedded, mobile...), I'd love to hear about it.
- 💬 **Ask me about** C/C++, Java, Functional Programming, OOP.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** bocaalinal@gmail.com or [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-maria-boca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alina-maria-boca-6aa3631b1/))
- 😄 **Pronouns:** She/Her
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Outside of coding I crochet, bake, and deep-clean things 🧁🧶
